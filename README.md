# Fruit-Classification
In this project, we use various models like ResNet, Random Forest, KNN and SVM to perform the classification. Later, we merge the result of Random Forest, KNN and SVM classifiers to improve the overall accuracy.
The fruit_classification_using_ml contains random forest, svm and knn
The fruit_classification_using_resnet contains the resnet implementation
